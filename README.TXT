POST MORTEM REVIEW (PMR):
This coding assignment was long and minorly challenging which made it very
fun to code in a sense. I had a good time figuring out everything and what 
I had to do for the assignment, using external resources such as the ASCII
chart, and then writing a good coding assignment with printing a text file
then reading from that same text file as well for the results with all the 
loops and conditional statements required for the coding assignment. I got 
stuck at some parts of the assignment but I was able to overcome all of them
and successfully figure out and finish the assignment completely the way 
I was required to do so.
